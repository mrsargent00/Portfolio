# Portfolio

## Description

A professional portfolio that will display my work, my skills, allow users to download my resume, and to contact me. Everything is clean, functional and well layed out. I had found a template on W3 schools as I was overwhelmed with how I wanted my portfolio to look, the link is provided below in the credits. From when I first built the portfolio to now and seeing the change that went into it, is amazing. I wanted something simple, as I know this is not the final look of the portfolio, one day it may have much more that will show case my skills.

As time goes on, I do plan on either adding more.


## Installation

A deployed link, so its just a simple click. Each photo once clicked will open a new tab for users, and will allow them to interact with the website that has been featured.

## Usage

This Portfolio will be for professional use, I wanted it to be more my style for the first run, but will update it as time goes on to be the best professional portfolio that I can achieve. It will display my four favorite projects that I am extremely proud of, with links to the actual page (steam page if its a video game), or to the website. Eventually the buttons on the top will take the user through each sections, I like to keep it organized, and well thought out so anyone can look through the work in a very organized fashion.

## Features

Side navagation works to bring users to certain parts of the page, and will stay at the side. When the page is moved around then the portfolio will adjust accordingly to the screen size. Each image has been linked to the appropriate website, and the email feature does allow users to email me directly.
