# Portfolio

## Description

This is my portfolio, as stitch once said "it may be small and broken, but its still good" and that is how I feel about this, its something I never done before. It was something that I never thought I could make, at this time, I only have offical project, and that is the Horiseon website where I updated code. The other images are place holders for other projects, one that I am working on outside of class, and extremely excited for! The buttons do not work either, as there isnt stuff to link to, but they will be used to link to different parts of the portfolio, and jump to a new place like a nice tab. Eventually it will look so much more professional, and more functional as time goes on!


## Installation

The project is a simple website, just clink the link and it will open up the page. If you click on the Horiseon photo, it will take you to the linked page, but will have to hit the back button to go back to the portfolio.

## Usage

This Portfolio will be for professional use, I wanted it to be more my style for the first run, but will update it as time goes on to be the best professional portfolio that I can achieve. It will display my four favorite projects that I am extremely proud of, with links to the actual page (steam page if its a video game), or to the website. Eventually the buttons on the top will take the user through each sections, I like to keep it organized, and well thought out so anyone can look through the work in a very organized fashion.
