   <p style="font-size: large;"> Hayner Internal Medicine, Howell MI: Medical Assistant</p>
    <p>September 2023 - present</p>
        <p>Working in a privately owned office alongside other medical professionals involves close collaboration to ensure seamless patient care. I coordinate appointments, discuss treatment plans, and maintain a welcoming environment for patients. This includes preparing examination rooms, managing supplies, and assisting with medical procedures like 
            joint injections and blood draws. Additionally, I handle medication management, ensuring accuracy and patient safety. When managing administrative tasks like answering phones and scheduling appointments, I prioritize efficiently addressing patient needs.

<br>

    <p style="font-size: large;">McLaren, Lansing MI: Front Receptionist</p>
        <p>June 2023- September 2023</p>
             <p>As the primary coordinator of appointment management, my role encompasses handling appointments for both new and established patients, as well as facilitating doctor requests efficiently. This involves not only scheduling appointments but also ensuring that patients are allocated appropriate time slots based on their needs 
                and the availability of healthcare providers. I prioritize urgent cases, coordinate specialist referrals, and accommodate patient scheduling preferences to optimize the patient experience. Effective communication is integral to my responsibilities, extending beyond mere message relay between the front desk and medical assistants. 
                It involves fostering a cohesive team environment where everyone is aware of the current patient load, any special instructions or requests, and any changes to the schedule that may arise throughout the day. This clear communication ensures smooth transitions between different stages of patient care and enhances overall operational efficiency.
                In addition to appointment management and communication, I was involved in diverse administrative tasks crucial to the functioning of the healthcare environment. This includes processing refill requests, handling phone calls, managing messages from the portal, and efficiently addressing walk-in patients. Moreover, I maintained 
                accurate patient records, process insurance documentation, verify patient information, and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements such as HIPAA for patient privacy and confidentiality. Proactive management of walk-in patients is particularly important in maintaining efficiency. I triage walk-ins based on the severity of 
                their condition, coordinate with healthcare providers to accommodate urgent cases, and manage patient expectations regarding wait times and available services. In essence, my role went beyond appointment scheduling and administrative support; it encompasses ensuring seamless patient care delivery and operational excellence in 
                a dynamic healthcare setting.</p>

                Given the fast-paced nature of urgent care, I must also excel in managing multiple tasks simultaneously. This includes maintaining supply inventories, restocking examination rooms, and ensuring that equipment is properly sanitized and readily available for use. By proactively managing workflow, I help optimize efficiency and minimize wait times for patients.

         <p>Working as a float Medical Assistant across various specialties, I gained diverse experience in Internal Medicine, Pediatric Pulmonary, Urology, and Neurology.

    <p style="font-size: large;">St. Joseph's Mercy Hospital, Ypsilanti, MI: Patient Care Technician</p>
         <p>November 2021 - December 2021</p>
         <p>Being in charge of patients intake when they are admitted to the unit I worked for, I had to inspect the patient to make note of any issues/ modifications.
         I made sure the patient was hooked up to the proper equipment for monitoring; EKG set up, pulse ox, and sometimes a bed alarm. Every four hours I would enter 
         the patients rooms and check in on them. Sometimes bathing, brushing, and wiping patients who were bed ridden as well as turning them.
         Charting every hour, on the hour, about the patient, including urine output, what side they are laying on, heart rate, pulse ox and respirations, I also had to
         work along side doctors and nurses to make sure meds were dispensed. IV placement, blood draws through the IV, IV flush, and assistanting with bathroom breaks. Working Midnights,
        in the COVID unit was emotionally tolling, many people had passed while I worked there, when it happened on my shift. I was in charge of
        contacting the morgue, removing the IV, or the bone port if the patient was a code blue, cleaning up the patient to be presentable for their family.
        Which is when I would restock the room, make sure sheets have been changed, and get the room prepped for the new admittion.</p>
