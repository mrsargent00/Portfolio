                 <p>Hello, my name is Megan. I am twenty two years old, and going to two different colleges. I am a registered Medical Assistant and have worked in the medical field since 2020. I graduated as a medical assistant with a 3.8 gpa in an accelerated program, I find this as my greatest achievement in my academic life. Currently, I am doing two different colleges, I am going for my associates in Computer Science at Lansing Community College, and Coding Boot Camp at MSU. Once it is closer to October, I will be applying to MSU to go for a bachelor's degree in Computer science, with a minor of game development. Doing a whole career change from the medical field to becoming a programmer is a bit scary, as I don't have much experience in coding, but I am doing so much to overcome this new endeavor. A lot of people that I have worked with in the medical field call me an overachiever. I love to get my work done to the best of my ability, and I like to stay on top of work. I'm very reliable, trustworthy and hardworking.</p>
                 <p>Outside of work and school, I love to be outdoors; swimming, hiking, camping and so on. Whenever it's raining, or I need some me time, I am found with either a book, or my kindle in hand. I play video games in whatever time I have whenever I'm not outside, or reading, and love exploring the world of PC gaming. I used to play games on my old laptop, it couldn't even handle the Sims 3. So when my boyfriend built my computer, I was so ecstatic to play games that I owned on steam for so long, such as the Sims 3. The books I love to read are typically horror related, have suspense, and a mature read to them. I have a collection of books that I have yet to read, but are interested in. I just havenâ€™t had the energy to start a new series when I'm in the middle of one. Books, writing, and video games were an escape from reality when I was growing up. I didn't have much of a childhood, but I don't let that set me back, and continue to grow, learn, and establish who I am. </p>
                 <p>Currently I have two cats, and live in a townhome with my amazing boyfriend. It's a fantastic upgrade compared to the apartment that I lived in my entire life. I get to decorate, paint and add sticker type features to the walls and floors to my heart's desire. I love to decorate and do different styles in rooms, especially as I flesh out what type of style I love. Currently, I have the bedroom painted a dark green, I have a peel and stick wallpaper picked out, and will be adding it to the wall  that our bed rests against. I plan on getting a gold curtain rod with gray curtains, accented with either a leaf type print on it, or something with flow. I also plan on adding floating shelves, actual plants, and other fine features to pull the room together. There is so much about me that has different sides, I would love to explore and explain each and every side, as I find them different from one another.</p>
                 <p>As my adventure changes, my portfolio will grow with it. My experience will change as well, and get better as time goes on. I am grateful to have at least one project that I worked on up and on the portfolio, eventually going to be replaced with something that is truely, hand made.</p>
